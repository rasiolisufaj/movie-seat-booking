► Selecting Movie & Seats From UI, 

select container,
we want to select all row seats that are available [not occupied] ,, check how ;)
we want count and total.
we want the select list 

we want the ticketPrice => ?? the value of the select list [smth like that,, check when you create html]
we want te ticketPrice to be a number not a string

MAKE A TEST


when we click on a seat we want to change the class to selected, (to turn blue)
→ we can do that with forEach or 
  we can add a click event to the container,,, so we can click everywhere,, but where we click, if it has(contains) a class of seat and does not have a class of occupies {
    add the selected class !!
    toggle() => check toggle
    we can use add and remove, but we want toggle because when we click again we want to remove it ,
    SEARCH!

    also when we select seats we want to call the function which updates the seats and the price
  }

---------------------------------------------
Update the TOTAL and the Price

updateSelectedCount()
CREATE THE FUNCTION ABOVE THE EVENT LISTENERS

→ the function will get the selected seats

Make a test what it returns...

→ the function will get the length of the nodelist

→ the function will update the count text

→ the function will update the total text

REMEMBER: When we say get: -> store that value in a variable
---------------------------------------------

When we select another movie we want to update the price

→ we will ad a change event listener to the movieSelect
  and we will set te ticket price to the value of the selected ticket (we want it number)
  ► we will call the function that updates the text and total
_______________________________________________________

►Save Data To Local Storage

we need to write that code inside the function that updates the text and total

we need to get seatsIndex

[→we need to copy selected seats into arr
→map through array
  →return a new array indexes
    we will use spread operator to get all the seats
    and indexOf(seat)]

we will use spread operator. [SEARCH] developer.mozilla.org

we have an array

save that to local storage,
remember JSON stringify
--------------------------------------------

when we reload the page we want the selected seats to stay selected, also we want the selected film to stay selected

we need to get the index of the selected movie
we will set them to a function setMovieData()↓↓↓↓
  e.target.selectedIndex
  also we want the price
↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑

the function will take the movieIndex and the moviePrice as parameters
  the function will save them to localStorage , so:
  localStorage.setItem(key,value)
  localStorage.setItem(key,value)

_______________________________________________________

► POPULATE UI WITH SAVED DATA 

right under the selected things, we will call a function 
populateUI();

//Get data from localStorage and populate UI
we will create a function populateUI
  we will get selected seats from local storage
    we set it to JSON stringify before,, what do we need now?

we have to check if there are any seats in the local storage and then  / loop through , and for the seats that are in the local storage we want to add the selected class, so thay can be updated at the UI

we need to make sure if there are selected seats and also if that's not an empty array

check by yourself [2:50]
